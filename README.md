# Reinforced concrete beam design

My first-ever website featuring a calculator designed for civil engineers. This tool helps to determine the required area of longitudinal reinforcement for a simply supported concrete beam with a rectangular cross-section.

## Purpose of this website

This website was created solely for learning purposes. Civil engineers commonly utilize dedicated software for these calculations, often dealing with more intricate scenarios.
